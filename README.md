# Apollo Nightly
Apollo nightly is a debloated version of Apollo that is more widely accesible on older and slower laptops,
>
> it has all of the same features as Apollo, and loads faster too, so if you have an older model laptop, id recomend using nightly,
nightly is also a pre-release platform of all Apollo versions,

not sure if theres much more i can add, thats really all there is
