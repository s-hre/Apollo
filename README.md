Well kind soul, im glad you asked!

> why?

> how did you do it?

how did i do it..? I'm fast, and you're slow, thats how I did it.

please if you can, help with my side project [ArtemisWeb](https://github.com/s-hre/ArtemisWeb)

## How to install
Firstly, go to [Releases]([https://github.com/s-hre/Apollo-Project/releases/tag/v0.1](https://github.com/s-hre/Apollo/releases)) and install `apollo.bat`, you will see a `shaveinstaller.exe` but that is not needed,
once you install the `apollo.bat` run it! from there, agree, and install!

If you're using the nightly build of apollo it will be almost the same install but you will use the [Nightly Releases](https://github.com/s-hre/Apollo/releases/tag/v0.2.3)
