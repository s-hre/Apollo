Well kind soul, im glad you asked!
the **Apollo** project, grants access to far more applications on your school computer,
many, which i will be providing myself
> why?

why not? who doesnt wanna play games in class?
> how did you do it?

how did i do it..? I'm fast, and you're slow, thats how I did it.

## How to install
Firstly, go to [Releases](https://github.com/s-hre/Apollo-Project/releases/tag/v0.1) and install `apollo.bat`, you will see a `shaveinstaller.exe` but that is not needed,
once you install the `apollo.bat` run it! from there, agree, and install!
