# Apollo Nightly
Looks like you found the nightly build for Apollo, congrats!
If this wasn't what you were looking for, heres the [main project.](https://github.com/s-hre/Apollo-Project)
but if this was then, let me tell you about our (my) nightly build!
## Uses and Udos
Apollo nightly is for developers to check their compatability without having to wait for a whole new build to release,
Apollo nightly will get far more consistent (and far more unstable) releases.
> [!NOTE]
> Even if you are a developer, i still would reccomend using the stable releases rather than the nightly build.
